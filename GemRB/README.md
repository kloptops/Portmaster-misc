# Portmaster-GemRB

This is the configuration files and the required steps to build the GemRB engine for handheld emulator devices (Anbernic RG351V/MP, RG353P/V/M, RG552, etc.) using the PortMaster scripts for launching.

# Installation

Use PortMaster to install gemrb, copy the desired game or games into `{PORTFOLDER}/gemrb/games/{GAME_ID}`. On launch it will ask you to choose the game if it detects multiple games.

# Game folder structure

When you install the game to your sd-card in `{PORTFOLDER}/gemrb/games/{GAME_ID}`, the recommended directory names are as below:

- **bg1** for Baldur's Gate 1
- **bg2** for Baldur's Gate 2
- **iwd** for Icewind Dale
- **iwd2** for Icewind Dale 2
- **pst** for Planescape Torment

The game selection system will do its best to figure out the name of the game if you don't follow these instructions.

## Required libs

- the following libraries from Debian 11 Bullseye Aarch64
  - libpython3.9 & library files

 
## Building

    git clone https://github.com/kloptops/gemrb.git

    cd gemrb

    mkdir build

    cd build

    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -DLAYOUT=home  -DUSE_ICONV=OFF -DDISABLE_VIDEOCORE=ON -DUSE_LIBVLC=OFF -DSDL_BACKEND=SDL2 -DSDL_DISABLE_CONTROLLER_API="ON" -DSDL_RESOLUTION_INDEPENDANCE="ON" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:FILE="engine"

    cd engine

    zip -9r ../engine.zip engine/

    cd ..

At the end, you want the `engine.zip`.
