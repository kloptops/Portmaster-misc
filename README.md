# PortMaster - Miscellaneous

This repo is for miscellaneous ports that don't require a full port for each release. Eventually I may combine the repos to keep all my stuff together.


# General structure.

- Port Name
  - build/
    - Files that get built for this port live here, but won't be commited to the repo
  - portname/
    - files & scripts that are needed for the port to work
  - Port Name.sh
    - the file that is run to start the game.
